# AArch64-Assembler
Main Purpose: Takes in assembly source code and converts it into binary executable code.
What I coded: 
1. assemble.c and .h files - Contains the main body of the algorithm
2. structure.c and .h files - Contains all the key structs and related functions for them


All the other modules are for dealing with specific types of instructions, which is signalled by looking at specific bits in the 32bit word
